class CaptureConsumer(ABC):
    """User-facing base class for capture consumers.

    The default implementation accumulates ``CaptureChunk``s per
    ``CaptureKey`` in CPU memory until ``CaptureFinalize`` arrives,
    then invokes ``on_capture(key, tensor, sidecar)`` with the
    concatenated tensor. Subclasses override ``on_capture`` and
    usually nothing else.

    Subclasses set class-level metadata:

    - ``location``: where the consumer runs. ``"worker"`` (default)
      runs in the engine-core subprocess alongside the model runner
      with direct in-process access to the capture manager and no
      IPC overhead. ``"driver"`` runs in the main Python process
      where the ``LLM`` lives; vLLM transparently handles the
      worker→driver plumbing via ``torch.multiprocessing.Queue``
      with shared-memory tensor handoff.
    - ``required_sidecar_fields``: optional sidecar field names the
      framework must populate for this consumer.
      ``vllm_internal_request_id`` is always present.
    - ``reads_client_spec``: whether the consumer accepts per-request
      opt-in via ``SamplingParams.capture[consumer_name]``. Default
      ``False`` — most consumers have a global spec set at
      registration time.
    - ``wants_device_tensors``: when ``True``, the manager delivers the
      captured rows to this consumer *on the model device* (no D2H
      copy), synchronously after the forward, so ``on_capture`` runs
      the consumer's compute (e.g. an SAE encode) on the GPU. Default
      ``False`` — consumers receive host (CPU) tensors. A step whose
      rows are wanted only by device consumers skips the host dispatch
      path entirely.

    Override points, in order of necessity:

    - ``__init__(self, vllm_config, params)`` — called once at engine
      startup.
    - ``global_capture_spec()`` — the consumer's global capture spec,
      applied to every request. Default ``None``.
    - ``validate_client_spec(raw_spec, ctx)`` — if
      ``reads_client_spec = True``, called at admission time.
      Must return a ``CaptureSpec`` or raise
      ``CaptureValidationError``.
    - ``on_capture(key, tensor, sidecar)`` — the main override.
    - ``on_error(key, error)`` — called on capture failure for this
      key. Default ``pass``.
    - ``shutdown(timeout)`` — called on engine teardown. Default
      ``pass``.
